# MySongs

This project was developed as part of a Java challenge proposed during my studies on the Alura platform. The goal was to put into practice key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **class hierarchy modeling**.

## üìñ Project Description

The challenge was to build a small music application, simulating the playback of **songs** and **podcasts**. At the core of the application is a superclass called `Audio`, which contains shared attributes:

- Title  
- Duration  
- Total plays  
- Likes  
- Rating  

From this base class, two subclasses were created: `Musica` and `Podcast`. Each subclass has specific properties and behaviors. Encapsulation is used so that the main application does **not** directly access the class attributes, relying instead on well-defined methods.

## üß† Key Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Class inheritance and specialization  
- Attribute encapsulation using access modifiers  
- Use of getters, setters, and methods to control access  
- Clean and modular code organization in Java
